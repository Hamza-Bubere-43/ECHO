# ECHO: A Mental Wellness Support System

This project develops an intelligent therapy chatbot powered by Llama 2, tailored for users aged 16‚Äì22. It combines intent detection and emotion classification (based on Ekman‚Äôs 7 basic emotions) to deliver emotionally aligned, compassionate responses that support mental wellness.

Designed with LoRA-based fine-tuning and model quantization, the chatbot runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware. Its goal is to simulate human-like therapeutic interactions with a focus on empathy, privacy, and personalization.

# üîç Current Limitations
Narrow demographic focus restricts its general use.

Ekman‚Äôs model limits nuanced emotion understanding.

Dataset lacks therapy-specific and diverse conversational data.

Basic privacy safeguards exist; advanced methods like differential privacy are planned.

No current integration with EHR or therapeutic monitoring systems.

Lacks ability to handle rare emotional scenarios or long-tail queries.

# üöÄ Future Goals
Expand to support broader age ranges and nuanced emotional states.

Enrich datasets with CBT, DBT, and ACT-based dialogues.

Integrate secure APIs and healthcare compliance features.

Employ few-shot learning and synthetic data generation for rare scenarios.

This project sets the groundwork for a secure, empathetic, and scalable AI therapy assistant for youth mental health.
